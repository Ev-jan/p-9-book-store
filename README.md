# P-9-bookstore
_course project_

Welcome to the Not-So-Impressive Bookstore project! While not yet perfect, it was designed with passion and enthusiasm.

## What is the Bookstore?

This is a front-end web application that allows users to browse books from the Google Books API. Users can view book details, add them to their cart, and simulate a purchase. While the project currently lacks a backend, it uses localStorage to mock some backend behavior. The backend will come in a while as soon as I get to learning Node.js

## Approaches and Methodologies

While this project is far from perfect, the author attempted to follow best practices and employ modern web development techniques. The project was built using HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript, and uses the following tools:

   * webpack for bundling and building the project
   * Prettier for code formatting

The code was designed with an object-oriented approach, with reusable classes for handling book data, the cart, and UI components. The project uses the Mediator pattern to enable communication between components without tight coupling The project also follows the Feature-Sliced-Design methodoloy (or at least makes a valid attempt at following it) to reduce coupling and enhance cohesion.

## Highlights
* Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices
* Scalable and flexible architecture for efficient data storage and retrieval
* Modular and reusable code for easy maintenance and extensibility
* Clear and readable code with consistent naming conventions.
